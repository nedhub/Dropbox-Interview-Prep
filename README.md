**Coding and System Design Tips**

As always, you must talk your way through the problem and explain your reasoning. You should **ALWAYS** talk about performance (system performance for system design and time/space complexity for the coding problems) and talk about testing, even if the interviewer does not prompt you to. 

**Coding Question List**: 

1. **Id Allocator** - Create a class that can allocate and release ids. The image in the packet is wrong. Please see [this image](https://github.com/insideofdrop/Dropbox-Interview-Prep/blob/main/Binary%20Heap.png).

This question is **EXTREMELY** popular and is asked in most onsite interviews, even if you're not a recent graduate.

2. **Download File / BitTorrent** - Create a class that will receive pieces of a file and tell whether the file can be assembled from the pieces. 

This question is mostly for new graduates/phone screens. 

3. **Game of Life** - Conway's Game of Life - [Problem on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/)
